        "The concept of AI emerged in the mid-20th century with the idea that machines could be programmed to think and learn like humans by using available information and reason to solve problems and make decisions. Early research focused on problem-solving using formal rules and logic. Over time, the field expanded to include machine learning and deep learning, which allow machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Today, AI is integrated into various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. It powers technologies such as virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, predictive analytics, and personalized recommendations."
