        "The Internet of Things (IoT) represents the interconnection of everyday objects through the internet, enabling them to send and receive data from real world interactions and perform actions based on that data. The term was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 during his work on RFID supply chains. Since then, IoT has continued to evolve, with applications ranging from smart homes and wearables to industrial automation and agriculture. Some examples of IoT device use cases include monitoring home security, tracking health metrics through wearables, and optimizing agricultural practices through monitoring of soil conditions.\n",

        "*   Smartphones - user interfaces for controlling and monitoring IoT devices. Enable mobile access to IoT data and control through dedicated apps\n",
